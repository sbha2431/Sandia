\subsection{Global to local surveillance specifications}
In order to reduce the multi-agent surveillance synthesis problem for a given surveillance specification $\varphi$ to solving a number of single-sensor surveillance subgames, we need to provide local surveillance objectives for the individual subgames. The local objectives should be such that by composing strategies that are winning with respect to the local objectives we should obtain a strategy that is winning for the global surveillance objective. More precisely, we have to provide local surveillance specifications $\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_n$ such that if for each $i$ it holds that $f_{s_i}$ is  a winning strategy for the sensor in $(G^i,\varphi_i)$, then the strategy $f_{s_1}\otimes \ldots \otimes f_{s_n}$ is  a joint winning strategy for the sensors in $(G,\varphi)$.

Recall that the surveillance objective $\varphi$ is of the form $\LTLglobally p_b$, or $\LTLglobally\LTLfinally p_b$, or $\LTLglobally p_a \wedge \LTLglobally\LTLfinally p_b$, where $a > b$.
