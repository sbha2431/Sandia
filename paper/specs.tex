\subsection{Global to local surveillance specifications}
We are given a global surveillance game with a surveillance specification $\varphi$. However, we never solve the global game since we break up the problem into small subgames. We thus need to design the local surveillance specification $\varphi_i$ for the individual subgames such that if $\outcome(G^{i}_{\widetilde{S}_\belief},f_{s_i},f_{t_i}) \models \varphi_i$, then the composed strategy for all agents must satisfy $\varphi$
