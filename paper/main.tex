\section{CONCLUSIONS}
We presented a method for decentralized synthesis of surveillance strategies for a mobile sensor network working with static sensors. Problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable can be solved by decomposing the global game into local subgames for each sensor with individual surveillance specifications. We show that though each game is solved completely independently with no information sharing, we can still guarantee global surveillance properties.

For future work, we aim to incorporate false positives in static alarm triggers as well as noisy observations from the mobile sensors while still guaranteeing surveillance specifications.
